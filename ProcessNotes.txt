1. The __init__.py means the website folder is a python package and allows us to import anything from into somewhere else.
2. Flask is lightweight python framework that allows you to make website very quickly and easily. to install run two commands: 'pip install flask' and 'pip install flask-login'
3. Configure your init.py file as shown
4. Configure main.py file. 
5. setup the routes for the website. Go to the views.py file and import Blueprint (this allows everything to be organized neatly) then write the "views = Blueprint.." command. Repeat this also for the auth file as per shown.
6. Then add your url paths for each page you need.
7. Register each page and Blueprint in the init.py file. When you register the blueprints, whatever you set the url prefix to will prefix the actual url you set in the views/auth files. 
8. in your auth.py file define the routes for each of the pages which will be associated with the authentication process (i.e. login, logout and signup)
9. next is the templates folder. This is used for the html that is going to be displayed for each page. We use a framework call Jinja to help us run python without our html pages rather than javascript. When reading documentation, you need to focus on the Template Designer Documentation.
10. Create a base.html file which is going to act as the bases for all future templates. In here, initialize the html and add in your bootstrap links (both for the css and javascript). Here you are going to use "Blocks" - these are sections which can be overridden by a child template. Learn about blocks here: https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/templates/#base-template
11. Anything that does not change, (i.e. images, css or javascript files) are put inside of the static folder. You then load them into your base.html file using a particular script. this is put at the bottom of the body:

    <script>
        type="text/javascript"
        src="{{ url_for('static', filename='index.js') }}"   --> this tells us to pull the url for the site when it is live, and look for the "static" folder. Then in there is a file call index.js. The squiggly brackets allow for us to write python. 
    </script>

12. Next you build out things like your navbar using standard bootstrap
13. Then create your child template. Starting with the extend syntax. See:https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/templates/#child-template
14. once the child template is defined, you have to render it so it can be seen on the screen. Go to view.py, import the render_template function from Flask and then change the route to return the newly defined template . 
15. whenever you are importing or want to use flask, you have to include is an imported item. 
16. Once the page is rendering the appropriate, you can continue to use blocks to add page specific content. If the view is authentication orientated page, done in auth.py. If it is a standard view, then view.py. 
17. To pass a variable through to be displayed in the front, you have initialise it in the view.py/auth.py files. To then render that in the template, you have to use two squiggly brackets like below:

{{ text }}

18. To do an if statement it is as follows:

{% if boolean == True %}
    This variable is True
{% endif %}

You have your if/else (python) is squiggly and percent signs and then the content to display in those scenarios is contained within. 


[19 Minutes In]

18. Need to tell each of the end points which HTTP Requests they accept by adding the information to the auth.py files.
19. when configuring the form, it is the name attribute which helps the post request know what label to assign to the data in the database. 
20. for displaying success and error messages we use the Flash function. if there are different messages and different scenarios, we use the flash with categories: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/flashing/#simple-flashing. You can us the IF and Else clauses to show different messages with different categories. Note also you can loop through two arrays at the same time and then check each one at different points in the if statement:


        {% with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=true) %} 
            {% if messages %} 
            {% for category, message in messages %} 
                {% if category =='error' %}
                <div class="alert alert-danger alter-dismissable fade show" role="alert">
                {{ message }}
                <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">
                    <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
                </button>
                </div>
            {% else %}
            <div class="alert alert-success alter-dismissable fade show" role="alert">
            {{ message }}
            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">
                <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
            </button>
            </div>
            {% endif %} {% endfor %} {% endif %} {% endwith %}


ESTABLISHING THE DATABASE 

This tutorial is great: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/connect-flask-to-a-database-with-flask-sqlalchemy/ 

1. in the __init__.py file, import you flask_sqlalchemy and initialise the database:

        from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

        db = SQLAlchemy()
        DB_Name = "database.db"

2. tell the flask application (__init__.py file) where the database is located for future queries to and from said database:

    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = f'sqlite:///{DB_Name}'
    db.init_app(app)

3. You then need to define the schema for the database. this is done in he models.py file. You have to import from the package (which is represented by a single dot) the database. If you are outside of the directory, you will replace the dot with the site you are importing from. So simply writing:

    from . import db

4. Also need to import the flask_login package which helps manage who can access these database. 
5. Define the columns for the different tables of data you want to store. you also, as with any database, need to define the data type and lengths that can be stored in that column:

        class User(db.Model, UserMixin):
            id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
            email = db.Column(db.String(150), unique=True)
            password = db.Column(db.String(150))
            first_name = db.Column(db.String(150))

6. After the tables are established, you have to associate each note with a user. You use foreign key to do this. This is a column in your database which always references another column in another database. To reference another database in the directory, simply write nameOfDatabase.columnName
If it is a one to many relationship (each user has many notes) you typically want to put the foreign key on the many item (in this case notes). You also want to reference the primary_key column. When referencing foreign key, the database name should start with lower case

Then you need to add a column which contains a list of all of the notes associated with that database. This is done by:

    notes = db.relationship('Note')

7. Then in the __init__.py file, you have to import and initialise the database during the program start-up. Write a function for the initialisation and call it after importing the models you have defined. 

        ...refix='/')
        
        import .models
        
        create_database(app)
        
        return app

    def create_database(app):
        if not path.exists('website/' + DB_Name):
            db.create_all(app=app)
            print('Database Created!')
