3. Configure your init.py file as shown
4. Configure main.py file. 
5. setup the routes for the website. Go to the views.py file and import Blueprint (this allows everything to be organised neatly) then write the "views = Blueprint.." command. Repeat this also for the auth file as per shown.

7. Register each page and Blueprint in the init.py file. When you register the blueprints, whatever you set the url prefix to will prefix the actual url you set in the views/auth files.
